# Resonant Coding: A Method to Master AI Chaos

### The Problem: An Avalanche of Instructions

As a technical lead at Mercado Libre, I faced a particular challenge. We were creating a project from scratch, but the team had few programmers with extensive experience, which required me to review a large part of the work. At the same time, the company pushed us to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to go faster.

The result was a paradox. We were flooded with an overwhelming amount of "code"—the instructions that make up programs—generated by these AIs. These instructions were often complicated to understand and didn't always meet the necessary quality standards. The review process became a frustrating and slow back-and-forth. Instead of speeding up, we had stalled.

I began to distill a solution based on the ideas of Steve Yegge and Dex Horthy[^context-eng]. What follows is the synthesis we apply in my team to land those concepts.

Curiously, the problem seemed to solve itself for a moment. In late October, the quality of the work the team delivered improved drastically. At first, I thought we had achieved something, but the reason was different: one of the AI programming tools we used had received a major update. This reinforced my conviction: we couldn't rely solely on tool improvements; we needed our own robust work process. Coincidentally, the book *Vibe Coding* was released around the same time, which validated many of the ideas I had already been developing and that we had begun to test with the team.

To ensure our process does not depend on the chance of a technical update, we must stop seeing AI as a magical black box and understand how its 'engine' really operates. Only by knowing its limits can we design a method that compensates for them.

### Understanding the Beast: How an AI "Thinks"

The main idea of this approach is to have a structured process for using AI that is both flexible and simple. For that, we first need to understand how these language models (LMs)[^lm] work.

We can understand their operation under four key premises:
- They are **text predictors**, like a cell phone's autocomplete, but immensely more advanced.
- They have **no memory**. They don't remember past interactions; they only see the text presented to them at a given moment[^memory].
- Their **attention is limited**. The longer the text we give them, the less efficient they become.
- They are **not predictable**. For the same question, they can give different answers.

To understand the power and limitation of their attention, let's do an exercise. Imagine asking at a dinner party, "What can I cook?". The possible answers are nearly infinite.

Now, add details: "What easy meal can I make for six friends on a Sunday if I have chicken, potatoes, and tomatoes?". The constrained question guides your friends toward a useful answer. The same happens with AIs: the quality of the response directly depends on the quality of the instructions we provide.

The problem is that their limited attention gets "dirty." Think of an analogy: we're camping and have to wash dishes in the river with a single bucket of water.
- For one dish, a bucket is plenty.
- For 10 dishes, the water starts to get murky.
- For 100 dishes, a bucket isn't enough, and the water becomes so dirty that the last dishes end up as bad or worse than before.
- Even worse, if we toss grease into the bucket (irrelevant information), the water becomes unusable.

To leverage the limited attention of AIs, we must be careful with the information we give them and break down large problems into smaller, manageable parts, using a "clean bucket of water" for each one. When we manage to match the information we provide (the 'frequency' of our message) with its attention capacity, the system 'resonates,' and the quality of the response improves dramatically.

### The Universal Tool: The Rule of 5

To ensure quality at each step, we rely on what Steve Yegge defines as the **"Rule of 5"**[^rule5], a quality filter that we adapt as follows:

1.  **Draft:** Create the initial content, aiming for completeness over perfection.
2.  **Correctness:** Is the information correct? Errors and inconsistencies are fixed.
3.  **Clarity:** Is it easy to understand? The language is simplified, and everything is explained clearly.
4.  **Edge Cases:** What could go wrong? Uncommon scenarios are considered.
5.  **Excellence:** Is this the best we can do? We look for ways to optimize or improve the result.

This review cycle is applied to each of the following phases until the result is solid.

### The Method: Research, Planning, and Implementation

We implement a three-phase methodology to manage this workflow.

#### 1. Research

Given a task, the first step is to use the AI to investigate. We ask it to tell us which parts of the program are important, how they connect, and if there is useful documentation. With that information, we ask it to create a summary. This summary is our first "bucket of water," carefully filled.

Once we have the draft, we subject it to the "Rule of 5" until the research is solid.

#### 2. Planning

With the research reviewed, we start a new conversation (a new "clean bucket of water"). We give it the summary and ask it to generate a detailed action plan.

Crucially, each task in the plan must be small enough to be performed in a single step. To ensure this, we break the plan into subtasks and describe each with the necessary information. Then, I apply the "Rule of 5" to each of these subtasks.

#### 3. Implementation

With well-defined tasks, the instruction "writing" phase becomes very predictable. The AI executes each small task independently. Its facility for this is enormous: it can modify dozens of files or create validation tests in seconds, something that would take a person hours.

Finally, once everything is done, we again apply the "Rule of 5" to the entire set to ensure everything is well-integrated. This approach of detecting errors as early as possible is something AIs are extremely efficient at[^shift].

### Reusing the Methodology

This workflow not only delivers a functioning program; it also leaves us with a 'byproduct' of instructions and criteria that have already been filtered by the Rule of 5. This is where the method becomes scalable: these pieces of knowledge become reusable templates for any other challenge, from medicine to event organizing.

We can apply the same method to generate the materials that guide us in each step, such as "prompts" or specific templates for a type of problem. For example, Charly uses this idea to create different "visions" of how to implement code, defining his preferences and style. This allows us to leverage methodologies already studied in other professions (from surgery to organizing a World Cup) so that the AI can help us apply them in our own processes.

### Quick Start Guide: How to Apply Resonant Coding Today

To turn this article from an essay into an actionable guide, here is a practical breakdown of what to do the next time you use an AI for a complex task.

#### 1. Choose Your Conversation (The Protocol)

Imagine you have three experts in a room. You wouldn't talk to all three at once about the same topic in a disorganized way. Assign a task to each:

*   **The Researcher (Conversation 1):** Your goal is to understand.
    *   **Request:** "Act as an expert in [topic]. I want to understand [situation]. Explain the key concepts and summarize them in 3 points."
    *   **Your Job:** Review the summary. If you need to apply the "Rule of 5" to refine it, **start a new conversation**, paste the summary, and ask the AI to improve it according to the rule. Iterate until the summary is solid.

*   **The Strategist (Conversation 2):** Your goal is to plan.
    *   **Action:** Start a new conversation ("clean the bucket").
    *   **Request:** "Based on this summary [paste the Researcher's summary], create a step-by-step plan to achieve [your goal]."
    *   **Your Job:** Review the plan. If you need to apply the "Rule of 5" to refine it, **start a new conversation**, paste the plan, and ask the AI to improve it according to the rule. Ask for adjustments until each step is clear, atomic, and robust.

*   **The Executor (Conversations 3+):** Your goal is to act.
    *   **Action:** For each step of the plan, start a new conversation.
    *   **Request:** "We are going to execute this step: [paste the step from the plan]."
    *   **Your Job:** Verify the result of each step. If you need to apply the "Rule of 5" to refine it, **start a new conversation**, paste the result, and ask the AI to improve it according to the rule.

#### 2. The Reason for the "Clean Bucket": Managing Context

Every time you start a new conversation, you ensure that the AI only sees the most relevant and refined information. This is crucial because the AI's "attention" is a limited resource. In long conversations, the context gets filled with drafts, corrections, and doubts, which "dirties the water" and reduces the quality of the responses.

To make it easier to "copy and paste" between conversations, you can ask the AI to summarize the final result in a clean format.

**Example Request at the end of a phase:**
> "Excellent. Now, summarize our final plan in a single plain text block, without any additional comments, so I can easily copy it."

#### 3. The Art of Asking

The quality of the response depends on the quality of the question. It's not the same to ask for "vacation ideas" as it is to provide details that guide the AI.

**Vague Request:**
> "Help me write a speech."

**Clear Request:**
> "Act as a professional speechwriter. I need a 5-minute speech for my best friend's wedding. The tone should be emotional but with a touch of humor. I want to include an anecdote about our childhood friendship and end with a good wish for the couple. Structure it into an introduction, development, and conclusion."

#### 4. Be the Director, not the Spectator

Your role is to direct the AI. Before accepting an answer, use the "Rule of 5" as a mental filter:

*   **Is it correct?** Does the information make sense?
*   **Is it clear?** Do I understand it at first glance?
*   **Does it consider alternatives?** What could go wrong?
*   **Is it excellent?** Or just "acceptable"?

If it doesn't meet your expectations, ask for an improvement.

#### 5. Define Your Style

If you have preferences about the communication style, save them. At the beginning of a conversation, you can ask the AI to adopt them.

*   **Example:** "In all your responses, use a formal and academic tone. Cite your sources when possible and structure the information in lists."

### Conclusion: Finding Resonance

A poorly worded instruction can generate hundreds of lines of wrong code. A poorly defined plan, tens of thousands. That's why this structured process is vital. The results of each step must be reviewed by people. AIs are good, but the knowledge that only exists in the team's heads must still be contributed by us.

This approach allows us to generate much higher quality work than I could do on my own, and in a fraction of the time[^future-work].

I chose the name "Resonant Coding" to name this synthesis of influences because it reminds me of the "Wave Station"[^ondas] I saw in college. If you shake a rope at a specific frequency, the chaos of movement transforms into fixed, harmonic structures. With this method, we do something similar: we adjust the process to find the correct frequency at which our system "vibrates." We stop generating noise and start creating with resonance[^phorma].
