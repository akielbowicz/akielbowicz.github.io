<hr />
<p>As a problem-solver at heart, I thrive on tackling challenges by
leveraging my diverse skill set and experiences.</p>
<p>I hold a degree in Physics, which honed my ability to model problems
by seeking simpler, yet effective solutions and finding the right level
of abstraction.</p>
<p>Professionally, I have been working as a Quantitative Developer and
Software Engineer, specializing in numerical code for Valuation and Risk
computation in Multi Asset Class systems. My production code experience
spans Python and C#, while I prefer Julia for Research and EDA, and use
Python or Powershell for tooling and scripting in Windows
environments.</p>
<p>My curiosity has led me to explore functional languages, resulting in
the development of DSL POCs in F# and Clojure. Additionally, I
participate in a reading group of Computational Category Theory book,
using OCaml.</p>
<p>I enjoy thinking in stochastic terms, considering possibilities and
their potential consequences. And continuously seek out new
opportunities to apply my analytical skills and passion for
problem-solving.</p>
