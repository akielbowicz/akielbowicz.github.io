## Executive Profile

Scientific Architect with a Physics background and elite tenure at Tier-1 financial institutions (Qontigo, SimCorp, Mercado Libre). I specialize in **High-Performance Computing**, **Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (NeuralSDEs)**, and **Domain-Specific Languages**. I help firms bridge the gap between "Research" and "Production" by engineering systems that are mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient.

My Physics degree (Licenciatura, University of Buenos Aires) taught me to model complex problems by finding the right level of abstraction. Combined with production experience across tier-1 financial institutions, I deliver solutions that are both theoretically sound and operationally robust.

## Signature Case Studies

### 1. The Performance Optimization Sprint (Qontigo)

**The Challenge**: Critical risk calculations were too slow for real-time reporting due to unoptimized convertible bond pricing engines.

**The Solution**: Led a forensic performance audit and implemented cache optimization strategies in the core C# numerical library.

**Outcome**: Achieved a **300% performance gain**, enabling real-time production risk reporting and significantly reducing Azure compute spend.

### 2. The Scientific AI Implementation (Research/SimCorp)

**The Challenge**: Traditional Monte Carlo simulations for European Option Pricing were computationally expensive; standard AI lacked mathematical constraints.

**The Solution**: Managed research into **Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (NeuralSDEs)** using **Julia**, combining deep learning with physical laws. Parallelly developed an LLM-based RAG system for querying complex financial documentation.

**Outcome**: Demonstrated superior convergence speeds over traditional solvers and established a framework for "Safe AI" in financial contexts.

### 3. The "Quant Experience" Architecture (SimCorp)

**The Challenge**: Quants struggled to interact with complex underlying pricing models, leading to errors and slow iteration.

**The Solution**: Designed and developed a Proof-of-Concept **Domain-Specific Language (DSL)** and integrated interactive Jupyter-based UIs (Voila/ipywidgets).

**Outcome**: Democratized access to complex models, allowing non-engineers to safely construct and test pricing logic.
