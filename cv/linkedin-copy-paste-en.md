## HEADLINE
Independent Consultant | Quantitative Software Architect | Research Software Engineering (RSE) for Financial Modeling

## LOCATION
Buenos Aires, Argentina

## ABOUT SECTION

I help financial institutions and technology companies solve complex quantitative and architectural challenges through elite-level consulting in scientific computing, risk management systems, and high-performance numerical software.

After 7+ years building mission-critical systems at JP Morgan, Qontigo/Axioma Risk, SimCorp, and Mercado Libre, I now work independently with organizations that need deep expertise in:

**Quantitative Finance & Risk Systems**
• Multi-asset class pricing and valuation frameworks
• Risk analytics and portfolio management systems
• Model calibration, numerical methods, and RSE-driven validation (ensuring computational rigor)
• Performance optimization for computational finance

**Scientific Software Architecture**
• High-performance numerical computing (Python, C#, Julia)
• Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) for financial modeling
• Research Software Engineering (RSE) Enablement: Standardizing analytical workflows from Jupyter to production using reproducibility standards and DevOps
• Migration and modernization of legacy quant systems
• Developer experience and tooling for analytical teams

**Specialized Training & Knowledge Transfer**
• Boutique Workshops: Research Software Engineering (RSE) Best Practices and High-Performance Numerical Computing with Julia
• Scientific and numeric software development training (best practices for data analysis, performance optimization, robust code design)
• Corporate workshops on quantitative finance and computational methods
• Technical mentorship for quant and engineering teams
• Interactive educational materials using Jupyter notebooks

My Physics background (Licenciatura, University of Buenos Aires) taught me to model complex problems by finding the right level of abstraction. Combined with production experience across tier-1 financial institutions, I deliver solutions that are both theoretically sound and operationally robust.

I specialize in the intersection where deep mathematical finance meets software engineering excellence—helping teams build systems that are correct, performant, and maintainable.

**How I Work:**
I offer flexible engagement models:
• Strategic Consulting: Architecture reviews, system design, technology evaluation
• Hands-On Development: POCs, migration projects, performance optimization
• Training & Enablement: Workshops, documentation, team upskilling

Whether you need to modernize a legacy valuation system, optimize computational performance, or build new analytical capabilities, I bring both strategic thinking and hands-on implementation skills.

**Open to consulting engagements globally (remote) and in Buenos Aires.**
