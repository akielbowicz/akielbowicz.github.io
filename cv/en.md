(he/him)

As a problem-solver at heart, I thrive on tackling challenges by leveraging my diverse skill set and experiences.

I hold a Licenciatura in Physics, which honed my ability to model problems by seeking simpler, yet effective solutions and finding the right level of abstraction. This academic background instilled in me the principle that there's always a path of least action.

Professionally, I have been working as a Quantitative Developer and Software Engineer, specializing in numerical code for Valuation and Risk computation in Multi Asset Class systems. My production code experience spans Python and C#, while I prefer Julia for Research and EDA, and use Python or Powershell for tooling and scripting in Windows environments.

My curiosity has led me to explore functional languages, resulting in the development of several DSL POCs in F# and Clojure. Additionally, I actively participate in a reading group focused on Computational Category Theory, using OCaml.

I enjoy thinking in stochastic terms, considering possibilities and their potential consequences, and continuously seek out new opportunities to apply my analytical skills and passion for problem-solving.
