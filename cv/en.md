I like to solve problems,

I grew up playing RPGs like Pokemon and Golden Sun, and there I learned that to solve harder problems one can gain experience by solving simpler problems. Also some platformers like Megaman X, where I learned that there are some skills that make some challenges much easier.

I enjoy stochastic, thinking in possibilities and their range of consequences that might follow from them.

I have a *Licenciatura* in Physics where I learned that to model nature one needs to search for simpler solutions (not easier), to try to find the right level of abstractions. Also, that there is always a path of least action.

I have been working as a Quantitative Developer and Software Engineer with a focus on numerical code for Valuation and Risk in Multi Asset Class systems. Most of the production code that I've developed is in Python or C#, for Research and EDA I prefer Julia, for tooling and scripting Python or (Powershell in Windows environments).

I been exploring funcional languages: I've developed a few DSL POCs in F# and Clojure, and this year I participate in a reading group that uses OCaml to follow [Computational Category Theory](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~david/categories/book/book.pdf)
