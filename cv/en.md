## About

I help financial institutions and technology companies solve complex quantitative and architectural challenges through specialized consulting in scientific computing, risk management systems, and high-performance numerical software.

With 7+ years building mission-critical systems at JP Morgan, Qontigo/Axioma Risk, SimCorp, and Mercado Libre, I now work independently with organizations that need deep expertise in quantitative finance and scientific computing.

My Physics degree (Licenciatura, University of Buenos Aires) taught me to model complex problems by finding the right level of abstraction. Combined with production experience across tier-1 financial institutions, I deliver solutions that are both theoretically sound and operationally robust.

**Core expertise**: Multi-asset pricing systems • Risk analytics • Numerical optimization • DSL development • Python/C#/Julia • Performance tuning • Team enablement

**Available for**: Strategic consulting, hands-on development, system modernization, performance optimization, technical training and workshops.
