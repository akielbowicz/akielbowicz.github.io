## About

I help financial institutions and technology companies solve complex quantitative and architectural challenges through elite-level consulting in scientific computing, risk management systems, and high-performance numerical software.

After 7+ years building mission-critical systems at JP Morgan, Qontigo/Axioma Risk, SimCorp, and Mercado Libre, I now work independently with organizations that need deep expertise in:

**Quantitative Finance & Risk Systems**
- Multi-asset class pricing and valuation frameworks
- Risk analytics and portfolio management systems
- Model calibration and numerical methods
- Performance optimization for computational finance

**Scientific Software Architecture**
- High-performance numerical computing (Python, C#, Julia)
- Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) for financial modeling
- Migration and modernization of legacy quant systems
- Developer experience and tooling for analytical teams

**Specialized Training & Knowledge Transfer**
- Scientific and numeric software development training (best practices for data analysis, performance optimization, robust code design)
- Corporate workshops on quantitative finance and computational methods
- Technical mentorship for quant and engineering teams
- Interactive educational materials using Jupyter notebooks

### What Makes My Approach Different

My Physics background (Licenciatura, University of Buenos Aires) taught me to model complex problems by finding the right level of abstraction. Combined with production experience across tier-1 financial institutions, I deliver solutions that are both theoretically sound and operationally robust.

I specialize in the intersection where deep mathematical finance meets software engineering excellence—helping teams build systems that are correct, performant, and maintainable.

### How I Work

I offer flexible engagement models:
- **Strategic Consulting**: Architecture reviews, system design, technology evaluation
- **Hands-On Development**: POCs, migration projects, performance optimization
- **Training & Enablement**: Workshops, documentation, team upskilling

Whether you need to modernize a legacy valuation system, optimize computational performance, or build new analytical capabilities, I bring both strategic thinking and hands-on implementation skills.
