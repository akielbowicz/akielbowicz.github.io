**Subject: Application for [Position Title]**

Dear [Mr./Ms./Mx. Last Name],

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the [Position Title] role at [Company Name], which I discovered via [Platform where you saw the advertisement]. With a proven track record of delivering architecturally robust, high-performance systems for tier-1 financial institutions, my background in quantitative finance, scientific computing, and system architecture aligns perfectly with the requirements of this position.

Throughout my career at firms like Qontigo, SimCorp, and J.P. Morgan, I have specialized in bridging the gap between complex research and production-ready software. A key highlight was at Qontigo, where I led an optimization initiative for a convertible bond pricing engine, achieving a **300% performance increase** that enabled real-time risk reporting. This is a testament to my expertise in High-Performance Computing (HPC), including performance auditing, vectorization, and cache optimization strategies.

My unique foundation in Physics, combined with hands-on experience in production environments, allows me to craft solutions that are both mathematically sound and operationally efficient. I have designed and implemented Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) to democratize access to complex financial models and have managed research into advanced techniques like Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (NeuralSDEs) to build safer, more deterministic AI systems.

I am highly proficient in a range of technologies, with production-level expertise in Python, C#, and Julia, and extensive experience with cloud deployment on Azure, CI/CD pipelines, and containerization. My recent role at Mercado Libre has further honed my skills in leading engineering teams and architecting scalable financial planning platforms in a large-scale, distributed environment.

I am confident that my ability to architect, optimize, and deliver mission-critical quantitative systems will bring significant value to your team. Thank you for your time and consideration. I have attached my CV for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications and experience in more detail.

Sincerely,

Sasha (Augusto) Kielbowicz
