# Sasha (Augusto) Kielbowicz

## Scientific Software Architect & Research Engineer

I architect high-performance engines for Quantitative Finance and Scientific Computing.

**The Challenge**: Most research code is mathematically brilliant but operationally fragile.

**My Solution**: I bridge the gap between research and production. I transform heavy computational models into robust, 3x faster production systems using **Julia**, **C#**, and **Stochastic AI**.

## What I Do

### High-Performance Computing (HPC) Sprints

Your Python models are too slow. I optimize numerical bottlenecks using Vectorization, Caching, and Parallelism.

**Proven results**: 300% performance gains at Axioma/Qontigo, enabling real-time risk calculations in production.

### Deterministic AI Architecture

Integration of Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (NeuralSDEs) and Math-Aware RAG systems. I build the "guardrails" that allow Large Language Models to handle financial data without hallucination.

**Key work**: Research into NeuralSDEs using Julia, combining deep learning with physical laws for superior convergence.

### Domain-Specific Language (DSL) Design

I design custom languages that allow Quants to define complex pricing models safely and intuitively, abstracting away the code complexity.

**Outcome**: Democratize access to complex models, allowing non-engineers to safely construct and test pricing logic.
